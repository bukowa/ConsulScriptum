# Consul Scriptum

*Consul Scriptum* is a Latin phrase that translates to "written with consideration" or "deliberately written." 

The term "consul" comes from "consulere," meaning "to consider" or "to deliberate," and "scriptum" means "written." This phrase could be used to emphasize that something was written thoughtfully or with careful consideration, rather than hastily or without intent.

In historical or legal contexts, it might refer to documents or texts that were prepared with significant deliberation or formal intent. However, the phrase is not commonly used in modern language, so its meaning can vary depending on the context in which it is applied.
