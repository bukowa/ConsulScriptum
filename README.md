# Consul Scriptum
"Consul Scriptum" is a Latin phrase that combines two terms:

Consul: In ancient Rome, a consul was one of the two highest-ranking elected officials who jointly governed the republic. The term later came to denote high-ranking officials or diplomats in other contexts.

Scriptum: This means "written" (from the verb scribere, "to write"). It can refer to a document, text, or written work.

Literally, "Consul Scriptum" translates to "written consul" or "the consul's writing." However, this phrasing is not a standard Latin expression or historical term. Its meaning would depend on context:

It could metaphorically imply "the written authority" or "a document issued by a consul."

In a creative or modern context, it might be used as a title for a fictional work, legal decree, or diplomatic text.


In reality this is a scripting console for Total War Rome 2.

### Limitations:
 - cannot use ENTER to send the command
 - cannot use the arrow keys to navigate the command history
 - cannot use the TAB key to autocomplete the command
 - cannot use the mouse to select text in the command that comes from history
 - cannot paste long commands - but you can type them...?! (I have no idea how to handle this and this is very annoying, the current workaround is to use scripting file via 'scriptum' as this will be loaded dynamically)
 - scriptum accepts only 10 custom scripts for now, i cannot find a way to dynamically create components (if anyone needs more just lmk)
