# Consul Scriptum

*Consul Scriptum* is a Latin phrase that translates to "written with consideration" or "deliberately written." 

The term "consul" comes from "consulere," meaning "to consider" or "to deliberate," and "scriptum" means "written." This phrase could be used to emphasize that something was written thoughtfully or with careful consideration, rather than hastily or without intent.

In historical or legal contexts, it might refer to documents or texts that were prepared with significant deliberation or formal intent. However, the phrase is not commonly used in modern language, so its meaning can vary depending on the context in which it is applied.

### Limitations:
 - cannot use ENTER to send the command
 - cannot use the arrow keys to navigate the command history
 - cannot use the TAB key to autocomplete the command
 - cannot use the mouse to select text in the command that comes from history
 - cannot paste long commands - but you can type them...?! (I have no idea how to handle this and this is very annoying, the current workaround is to use scripting file via 'scriptum' as this will be loaded dynamically)
 - scriptum accepts only 10 custom scripts for now, i cannot find a way to dynamically create components (if anyone needs more just lmk)
